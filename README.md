# IoT-Based-Smart-Waste-Management-System
An IoT-based smart waste management system using ESP32, ultrasonic and smoke sensors, with a web dashboard and MongoDB integration. It detects bin fill levels and smoke in real time and displays on a website which has a user-friendly interface with login authentication.

## Features

-  Real-time bin level detection via ultrasonic sensor
-  Smoke/gas detection for safety alerts using MQ-2 gas sensor
-  Automatic lid opening using IR proximity sensor and servo motor for touchless waste disposal.
-  Web dashboard with live monitoring
-  User login using Email
-  MongoDB cloud database storage
-  ML model to predict fill levels more accurately
